== Frequently asked questions ==

= What is so great about .desi? =
Until today, if you wanted to connect with desis around the world with content that you control you likely would be doing that on top of legacy and aging top-level domains like .com, .net, .org, and .in. But now you’ve got new options. That’s because the brand new .desi top-level domain is an officially sanctioned open Internet neighborhood just like the other domains, but also a powerful new targeting platform that brings desis together without restriction by geography. Dot desi is a space in which all registrants can confidently identify to the desi markets.

= Who is the target customer? =
Brands, individual or business, who are either from the desi markets (Indian sub-continent and diaspora) or are looking for effective means to connect with this vast, generally under-served market.

= Can anyone get a .desi domain? =
Absolutely, .desi is an open, un-restricted domain and available to anyone.

= Are there going to be premium names? =
Yes. They will be setting aside some limited premium names for both “buy it now” pricing as well as domain auctions.
